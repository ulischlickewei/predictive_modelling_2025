    "- **Standardized Residuals**: Identify potential outliers. These are defined as observations with $|\\text{standardized residual}| \\leq 3$. Standardized residuals can be computed by applying the [`get_influence()`](https://www.statsmodels.org/0.9.0/generated/statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence.OLSInfluence.html#statsmodels.stats.outliers_influence.OLSInfluence) method to the model, and by then accessing the [`resid_studentized_internal`]() attribute of the output.\n",
    "- **Leverage**: Identify observations that have unusual predictor values. To do so, compute the leverage statistic by taking the `hat_matrix_diag` attribute f the value returned by the `get_influence()` method which has to be applied to the trained model. Use $2 \\cdot \\frac{p+1}{n}$ as cutoff value for high-leverage observations.\n",
